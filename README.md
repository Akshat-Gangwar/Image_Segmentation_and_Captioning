# Image_Segmentation_and_Captioning
This is a Deep learning project I made during an internship.
It takes input images and provides captions for it describing what is happening in the image and it segments the subjects in the image

Guide to Use:
1) Run Model_train.ipynb on kaggle
2) Save the output model in a folder named "saved_models" as "image_captioning_coco_weights" & output 'vocab_coco.file' in a folder named "saved_vocabulary"
3) Run image-segmentation.ipynb on kaggle
4) Save this model in saved_models folder as "segmentation_model"
5) Run app.py using streamlit
